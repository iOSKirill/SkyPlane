# SkyPlane

The SkyPlane project is written in SwiftUI and is intended for the purchase of air tickets. The application contains several screens that provide a convenient and intuitive user interface.

- Map Screen: Here the user can view the flight route using the integrated map. Routes are displayed visually, allowing the user to easily navigate and explore their flight capabilities.
